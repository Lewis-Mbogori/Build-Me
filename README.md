# PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Engineers often face challenges in showcasing their work to the public. Traditional methods such as physical portfolios, personal websites, and professional networking platforms can be limiting in terms of reach, accessibility, and ease of use. This creates a gap where engineers struggle to effectively present their projects, innovations, and achievements to potential employers, clients, and peers.

# PROBLEM SOLUTION
To address this issue, we propose the development of a mobile application using Flutter that allows engineers to easily showcase their work. This app will provide a user-friendly platform for engineers to create, manage, and share their professional portfolios.

Some key features of the app will include;
1. Portfolio Creation and Management: Users can create detailed profiles, including personal information, educational background, work experience, and skill sets.
2. Project Showcasing: Engineers can upload and describe their projects, including images, videos, technical specifications, and outcomes.
3. Search and Discovery: Potential employers, clients, and peers can search for engineers based on specific criteria such as skills, experience, and project types.
4. Networking Features: The app will include social features such as following, liking, commenting, and direct messaging to facilitate networking and collaboration.

# END USERS
1. Engineers: The primary users who will benefit from the app are engineers looking to showcase their work. This includes civil, mechanical, electrical, software, and other engineering disciplines.
2. Clients: Individuals and businesses seeking engineering services can use the app to find and connect with engineers who have the relevant skills and experience.
3. Contractors
4. County Government
5. Quantity Surveyors
6. Private Developers
